## Gender Two Years on Hormone

Two years to the day my life changed in a significant way, I was miserable, with suicidal tendancies and a deep sadness that things were not right in the world.

At the time I had been referred to the Auckland Sexsual Health Service, running out of ADHB, the counciller I worked with was great they had help me clarify what I needed and wanted, the endocronologist well they would let me start hormones if I lost x amount of weight otherwise I would not be allowed them.
I had done my research and reading on HRT and to say the least it is a mess; it feels like its lets throw a dart and hope it hits the dart board type treatment; the ideas and concepts used are outdated using old methods and perhaps unsafe methods as well
