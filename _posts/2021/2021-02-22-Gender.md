## Gender Two Years on Hormone

I am coming out of lurking as its a significant day as it is my anniversay of Two years to the day my life changed in a significant way, I was miserable, with suicidal tendancies and a deep sadness that things were not right in the world.

At the time I had been referred to the Auckland Sexsual Health Service, running out of ADHB, the counciller I worked with was great they had help me clarify what I needed and wanted, the endocronologist well they would let me start hormones if I lost x amount of weight otherwise I would not be allowed them, they were a gatekeeper more than a healthcare professional (what I felt/feel)
I had done my research and reading on HRT and to say the least it is a mess; it feels like its lets throw a dart and hope it hits the dart board type treatment; the ideas and concepts used are outdated using old methods and perhaps unsafe methods as well.
So going to my gp with my research I requested to use an informed consent model, advising I am well aware of the risks of undergoing HRT (mainly DVT), but also advised that the risks of me not starting HRT are just as great if not greater and more real.
So working with my gp, I put in a plan of HRT, namely to achieve hormone values within normal female ranges; and to keep my gp happy start with a small dose and titrate up based on lab results;
I also was initially on Spironolactone in order to reduce testosterone, however I weened my self off this drug fairly quickly as it was not needed, as I attained oestradiol levels, and testosterone levels within female ranges, using bio identical medications and monotherapy  (progynova alone)
Now two years on I am adding Utrogestan (progesterone) to my HRT regimen.
I wish I had started this journey earlier, but I didnt out of fear of societal norms and acceptance; but society is not living my life and I need to be true to myself and this is the way in moving forward. I am not 100% where I want to be in been happy with my self, but I am moving forward slowly but forward nonetheless.
I also must make note of hair removal especialy facial hair removal I use the ladies from images beauty in Papatoetoe, Auckland and they are amazing; and the results of removing facial hair via electrolysis are amazing; If you can start this process as soon as you can do so, it helps immensily and after some patience you really can see the results;
For those who read this, thank you for listening and sharing in part of my story
