## Gender Two Years on Hormone

Two years to the day my life changed in a significant way, I was miserable, with suicidal tendancies and a deep sadness that things were not right in the world.

At the time I had been referred to the Auckland Sexsual Health Service, running out of ADHB, the counciller I worked with was great they had help me clarify what I needed and wanted, the endocronologist well they would let me start hormones if I lost x amount of weight otherwise I would not be allowed them.
