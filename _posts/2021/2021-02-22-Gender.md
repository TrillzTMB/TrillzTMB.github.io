## Gender Two Years on Hormone

Two years to the day my life changed in a significant way, I was miserable, with suicidal tendancies and a deep sadness that things were not right in the world.

At the time I had been referred to the Auckland Sexsual Health Service, running out of ADHB, the counciller I worked with was great they had help me clarify what I needed and wanted, the endocronologist well they would let me start hormones if I lost x amount of weight otherwise I would not be allowed them, they were a gatekeeper more than a healthcare professional (what I felt/feel)
I had done my research and reading on HRT and to say the least it is a mess; it feels like its lets throw a dart and hope it hits the dart board type treatment; the ideas and concepts used are outdated using old methods and perhaps unsafe methods as well.
So going to my gp with my research I requested to use an informed consent model, advising I am well aware of the risks of undergoing HRT (mainly DVT), but also advised that the risks of me not starting HRT are just as great if not greater and more real.
So working with my gp, I put in a plan of HRT, namely to achieve hormone values within normal female ranges; and to keep my gp happy start with a small dose and titrate up based on lab results;
I also was initially on Spironolactone, however I weened my self off this drug fairly quickly as it was not needed, as I attained oestradiol levels, and testosterone levels within female ranges, using monotherapy  (progynova alone)
